# Decision-Tree and Random Forest
Decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for the Regression and Classification. This graphical representation which classifies the data is called as the Decision Tree. 
In Random forest we grow multiple trees. And to classify a new object based on attributes, each tree provides with classifications. Thus the forest chooses the most voted classification (over all the trees in the forest). However, in case of regression, it picks up the average of outputs by different trees.
